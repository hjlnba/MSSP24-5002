The repository contains the code for 200 FE model updates using two objective functions under different noise conditions in numerical examples. 
In the code, "Sample 6" refers to the dataset generated by Latin Hypercube Sampling used for constructing the Kriging model. "mu_average" represents the average value of the parameters,
"yreal_average" is the average response corresponding to the parameters, and "S" denotes the standard deviation of the updated parameters. "GJ_bridge" showcases the updated results of the bridge.
